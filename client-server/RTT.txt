<p>&nbsp;</p>
<P> &quot;Off there to the right&#8212;somewhere&#8212;is a large island,&quot; said 
Whitney. &quot;It's rather a mystery&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;What island is it?&quot; Rainsford asked. &quot;The old charts call it 
Ship-Trap Island,&quot;' Whitney replied. &quot;A suggestive name, isn't it? 
Sailors have a curious dread of the place. I don't know why. Some 
superstition&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Can't see it,&quot; remarked Rainsford, trying to peer through the dank 
tropical night that was palpable as it pressed its thick warm blackness 
in upon the yacht. </P>
<P> &quot;You've good eyes,&quot; said Whitney, with a laugh, &quot;and I've seen you 
pick off a moose moving in the brown fall bush at four hundred yards, 
but even you can't see four miles or so through a moonless Caribbean 
night.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Nor four yards,&quot; admitted Rainsford. &quot;Ugh! It's like moist black 
velvet.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;It will be light enough in Rio,&quot; promised Whitney. &quot;We should make 
it in a few days. I hope the jaguar guns have come from Purdey's. We 
should have some good hunting up the Amazon. Great sport, hunting.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;The best sport in the world,&quot; agreed Rainsford. </P>
<P> &quot;For the hunter,&quot; amended Whitney. &quot;Not for the jaguar.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Don't talk rot, Whitney,&quot; said Rainsford. &quot;You're a big-game 
hunter, not a philosopher. </P>
<P> Who cares how a jaguar feels?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Perhaps the jaguar does,&quot; observed Whitney. </P>
<P> &quot;Bah! They've no understanding.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Even so, I rather think they understand one thing&#8212;fear. The fear 
of pain and the fear of death.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Nonsense,&quot; laughed Rainsford. &quot;This hot weather is making you 
soft, Whitney. Be a realist. The world is made up of two classes&#8212;the 
hunters and the huntees. Luckily, you and I are hunters. Do you think 
we've passed that island yet?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I can't tell in the dark. I hope so.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Why? &quot; asked Rainsford. </P>
<P> &quot;The place has a reputation&#8212;a bad one.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Cannibals?&quot; suggested Rainsford. </P>
<P> &quot;Hardly. Even cannibals wouldn't live in such a God-forsaken place. 
But it's gotten into sailor lore, somehow. Didn't you notice that the 
crew's nerves seemed a bit jumpy today?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;They were a bit strange, now you mention it. Even Captain 
Nielsen&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Yes, even that tough-minded old Swede, who'd go up to the devil 
himself and ask him for a light. Those fishy blue eyes held a look I 
never saw there before. All I could get out of him was `This place has 
an evil name among seafaring men, sir.' Then he said to me, very 
gravely, `Don't you feel anything?'&#8212;as if the air about us was 
actually poisonous. Now, you mustn't laugh when I tell you this&#8212;I did 
feel something like a sudden chill. </P>
<P> &quot;There was no breeze. The sea was as flat as a plate-glass window. 
We were drawing near the island then. What I felt was a&#8212;a mental 
chill; a sort of sudden dread.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Pure imagination,&quot; said Rainsford. </P>
<P> &quot;One superstitious sailor can taint the whole ship's company with 
his fear.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Maybe. But sometimes I think sailors have an extra sense that 
tells them when they are in danger. Sometimes I think evil is a 
tangible thing&#8212;with wave lengths, just as sound and light have. An 
evil place can, so to speak, broadcast vibrations of evil. Anyhow, I'm 
glad we're getting out of this zone. Well, I think I'll turn in now, 
Rainsford.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I'm not sleepy,&quot; said Rainsford. &quot;I'm going to smoke another pipe 
up on the afterdeck.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Good night, then, Rainsford. See you at breakfast.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Right. Good night, Whitney.&quot; </P>
<P> There was no sound in the night as Rainsford sat there but the 
muffled throb of the engine that drove the yacht swiftly through the 
darkness, and the swish and ripple of the wash of the propeller. </P>
<P> Rainsford, reclining in a steamer chair, indolently puffed on his 
favourite brier. The sensuous drowsiness of the night was on him.&quot; It's 
so dark,&quot; he thought, &quot;that I could sleep without closing my eyes; the 
night would be my eyelids&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> An abrupt sound startled him. Off to the right he heard it, and his 
ears, expert in such matters, could not be mistaken. Again he heard the 
sound, and again. Somewhere, off in the blackness, someone had fired a 
gun three times. </P>
<P> Rainsford sprang up and moved quickly to the rail, mystified. He 
strained his eyes in the direction from which the reports had come, but 
it was like trying to see through a blanket. </P>
<P> He leaped upon the rail and balanced himself there, to get greater 
elevation; his pipe, striking a rope, was knocked from his mouth. He 
lunged for it; a short, hoarse cry came from his lips as he realised he 
had reached too far and had lost his balance. The cry was pinched off 
short as the blood-warm waters of the Caribbean Sea dosed over his 
head. </P>
<P> He struggled up to the surface and tried to cry out, but the wash 
from the speeding yacht slapped him in the face and the salt water in 
his open mouth made him gag and strangle. Desperately he struck out 
with strong strokes after the receding lights of the yacht, but he 
stopped before he had swum fifty feet. A certain coolheadedness had 
come to him; it was not the first time he had been in a tight place. 
There was a chance that his cries could be heard by someone aboard the 
yacht, but that chance was slender and grew more slender as the yacht 
raced on. He wrestled himself out of his clothes and shouted with all 
his power. </P>
<P> The lights of the yacht became faint and ever-vanishing fireflies; 
then they were blotted out entirely by the night. </P>
<P> Rainsford remembered the shots. They had come from the right, and 
doggedly he swam in that direction, swimming with slow, deliberate 
strokes, conserving his strength. For a seemingly endless time he 
fought the sea. He began to count his strokes; he could do possibly a 
hundred more and then&#8212; Rainsford heard a sound. It came out of the 
darkness, a high screaming sound, the sound of an animal in an 
extremity of anguish and terror. </P>
<P> He did not recognise the animal that made the sound; he did not try 
to; with fresh vitality he swam toward the sound. He heard it again; 
then it was cut short by another noise, crisp, staccato. </P>
<P> &quot;Pistol shot,&quot; muttered Rainsford, swimming on. </P>
<P> Ten minutes of determined effort brought another sound to his ears 
- the most welcome he had ever heard&#8212;the muttering and growling of 
the sea breaking on a rocky shore. He was almost on the rocks before he 
saw them; on a night less calm he would have been shattered against 
them. With his remaining strength he dragged himself from the swirling 
waters. Jagged crags appeared to jut up into the opaqueness; he forced 
himself upward, hand over hand. Gasping, his hands raw, he reached a 
flat place at the top. Dense jungle came down to the very edge of the 
cliffs. What perils that tangle of trees and underbrush might hold for 
him did not concern Rainsford just then. All he knew was that he was 
safe from his enemy, the sea, and that utter weariness was on him. He 
flung himself down at the jungle edge and tumbled headlong into the 
deepest sleep of his life. </P>
<P> When he opened his eyes he knew from the position of the sun that 
it was late in the afternoon. Sleep had given him new vigour; a sharp 
hunger was picking at him. He looked about him, almost cheerfully. </P>
<P> &quot;Where there are pistol shots, there are men. Where there are men, 
there is food,&quot; he thought. But what kind of men, he wondered, in so 
forbidding a place? An unbroken front of snarled and ragged jungle 
fringed the shore. </P>
<P> He saw no sign of a trail through the closely knit web of weeds and 
trees; it was easier to go along the shore, and Rainsford floundered 
along by the water. Not far from where he landed, he stopped. </P>
<P> Some wounded thing&#8212;by the evidence, a large animal&#8212;had thrashed 
about in the underbrush; the jungle weeds were crushed down and the 
moss was lacerated; one patch of weeds was stained crimson. A small, 
glittering object not far away caught Rainsford's eye and he picked it 
up. It was an empty cartridge. </P>
<P> &quot;A twenty-two,&quot; he remarked. &quot;That's odd. It must have been a 
fairly large animal too. </P>
<P> The hunter had his nerve with him to tackle it with a light gun. 
It's clear that the brute put up a fight. I suppose the first three 
shots I heard was when the hunter flushed his quarry and wounded it. 
The last shot was when he trailed it here and finished it.&quot; </P>
<P> He examined the ground closely and found what he had hoped to find 
- the print of hunting boots. They pointed along the cliff in the 
direction he had been going. Eagerly he hurried along, now slipping on 
a rotten log or a loose stone, but making headway; night was beginning 
to settle down on the island. </P>
<P> Bleak darkness was blacking out the sea and jungle when Rainsford 
sighted the lights. He came upon them as he turned a crook in the coast 
line; and his first thought was that be had come upon a village, for 
there were many lights. But as he forged along he saw to his great 
astonishment that all the lights were in one enormous building&#8212;a 
lofty structure with pointed towers plunging upward into the gloom. His 
eyes made out the shadowy outlines of a palatial chateau; it was set on 
a high bluff, and on three sides of it cliffs dived down to where the 
sea licked greedy lips in the shadows. </P>
<P> &quot;Mirage,&quot; thought Rainsford. But it was no mirage, he found, when 
he opened the tall spiked iron gate. The stone steps were real enough; 
the massive door with a leering gargoyle for a knocker was real enough; 
yet above it all hung an air of unreality. </P>
<P> He lifted the knocker, and it creaked up stiffly, as if it had 
never before been used. He let it fall, and it startled him with its 
booming loudness. He thought he heard steps within; the door remained 
closed. Again Rainsford lifted the heavy knocker, and let it fall. The 
door opened then&#8212;opened as suddenly as if it were on a spring&#8212;and 
Rainsford stood blinking in the river of glaring gold light that poured 
out. The first thing Rainsford's eyes discerned was the largest man 
Rainsford had ever seen&#8212;a gigantic creature, solidly made and black 
bearded to the waist. In his hand the man held a long-barrelled 
revolver, and he was pointing it straight at Rainsford's heart. </P>
<P> Out of the snarl of beard two small eyes regarded Rainsford. </P>
<P> &quot;Don't be alarmed,&quot; said Rainsford, with a smile which he hoped was 
disarming. &quot;I'm no robber. I fell off a yacht. My name is Sanger 
Rainsford of New York City.&quot; </P>
<P> The menacing look in the eyes did not change. The revolver pointing 
as rigidly as if the giant were a statue. He gave no sign that he 
understood Rainsford's words, or that he had even heard them. He was 
dressed in uniform&#8212;a black uniform trimmed with grey astrakhan. </P>
<P> &quot;I'm Sanger Rainsford of New York,&quot; Rainsford began again. &quot;I fell 
off a yacht. I am hungry.&quot; </P>
<P> The man's only answer was to raise with his thumb the hammer of his 
revolver. Then Rainsford saw the man's free hand go to his forehead in 
a military salute, and he saw him click his heels together and stand at 
attention. Another man was coming down the broad marble steps, an 
erect, slender man in evening clothes. He advanced to Rainsford and 
held out his hand. </P>
<P> In a cultivated voice marked by a slight accent that gave it added 
precision and deliberateness, he said, &quot;It is a very great pleasure and 
honour to welcome Mr. Sanger Rainsford, the celebrated hunter, to my 
home.&quot; </P>
<P> Automatically Rainsford shook the man's hand. </P>
<P> &quot;I've read your book about hunting snow leopards in Tibet, you 
see,&quot; explained the man. </P>
<P> &quot;I am General Zaroff.&quot; </P>
<P> Rainsford's first impression was that the man was singularly 
handsome; his second was that there was an original, almost bizarre 
quality about the general's face. He was a tall man past middle age, 
for his hair was a vivid white; but his thick eyebrows and pointed 
military moustache were as black as the night from which Rainsford had 
come. His eyes, too, were black and very bright. He had high 
cheekbones, a sharpcut nose, a spare, dark face&#8212;the face of a man 
used to giving orders, the face of an aristocrat. Turning to the giant 
in uniform, the general made a sign. The giant put away his pistol, 
saluted, withdrew. </P>
<P> &quot;Ivan is an incredibly strong fellow,&quot; remarked the general, &quot;but 
he has the misfortune to be deaf and dumb. A simple fellow, but, I'm 
afraid, like all his race, a bit of a savage.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Is he Russian?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;He is a Cossack,&quot; said the general, and his smile showed red lips 
and pointed teeth. &quot;So am I.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Come,&quot; he said, &quot;we shouldn't be chatting here. We can talk later. 
Now you want clothes, food, rest. You shall have them. This is a 
most-restful spot.&quot; </P>
<P> Ivan had reappeared, and the general spoke to him with lips that 
moved but gave forth no sound. </P>
<P> &quot;Follow Ivan, if you please, Mr. Rainsford,&quot; said the general. &quot;I 
was about to have my dinner when you came. I'll wait for you. You'll 
find that my clothes will fit you, I think.&quot; </P>
<P> It was to a huge, beam-ceilinged bedroom with a canopied bed big 
enough for six men that Rainsford followed the silent giant. Ivan laid 
out an evening suit, and Rainsford, as he put it on, noticed that it 
came from a London tailor who ordinarily cut and sewed for none below 
the rank of duke. </P>
<P> The dining room to which Ivan conducted him was in many ways 
remarkable. There was a medieval magnificence about it; it suggested a 
baronial hall of feudal times with its oaken panels, its high ceiling, 
its vast refectory tables where twoscore men could sit down to eat. 
About the hall were mounted heads of many animals&#8212;lions, tigers, 
elephants, moose, bears; larger or more perfect specimens Rainsford had 
never seen. At the great table the general was sitting, alone. </P>
<P> &quot;You'll have a cocktail, Mr. Rainsford,&quot; he suggested. The cocktail 
was surpassingly good; and, Rainsford noted, the table appointments 
were of the finest&#8212;the linen, the crystal, the silver, the china. </P>
<P> They were eating borsch, the rich, red soup with whipped cream so 
dear to Russian palates. Half apologetically General Zaroff said, &quot;We 
do our best to preserve the amenities of civilisation here. Please 
forgive any lapses. We are well off the beaten track, you know. Do you 
think the champagne has suffered from its long ocean trip?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Not in the least,&quot; declared Rainsford. He was finding the general 
a most thoughtful and affable host, a true cosmopolite. But there was 
one small trait of .the general's that made Rainsford uncomfortable. 
Whenever he looked up from his plate he found the general studying him, 
appraising him narrowly. </P>
<P> &quot;Perhaps,&quot; said General Zaroff, &quot;you were surprised that I 
recognised your name. You see, I read all books on hunting published in 
English, French, and Russian. I have but one passion in my life, Mr. 
Rains. ford, and it is the hunt.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;You have some wonderful heads here,&quot; said Rainsford as he ate a 
particularly well-cooked filet mignon. &quot; That Cape buffalo is the 
largest I ever saw.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Oh, that fellow. Yes, he was a monster.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Did he charge you?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Hurled me against a tree,&quot; said the general. &quot;Fractured my skull. 
But I got the brute.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I've always thought,&quot; said Rainsford, &quot;that the Cape buffalo is 
the most dangerous of all big game.&quot; </P>
<P> For a moment the general did not reply; he was smiling his curious 
red-lipped smile. </P>
<P> Then he said slowly, &quot;No. You are wrong, sir. The Cape buffalo is 
not the most dangerous big game.&quot; He sipped his wine. &quot;Here in my 
preserve on this island,&quot; he said in the same slow tone, &quot;I hunt more 
dangerous game.&quot; </P>
<P> Rainsford expressed his surprise. &quot;Is there big game on this 
island?&quot; </P>
<P> The general nodded. &quot;The biggest.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Really?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Oh, it isn't here naturally, of course. I have to stock the 
island.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;What have you imported, general?&quot; Rainsford asked. &quot;Tigers?&quot; </P>
<P> The general smiled. &quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;Hunting tigers ceased to 
interest me some years ago. </P>
<P> I exhausted their possibilities, you see. No thrill left in tigers, 
no real danger. I live for danger, Mr. Rainsford.&quot; </P>
<P> The general took from his pocket a gold cigarette case and offered 
his guest a long black cigarette with a silver tip; it was perfumed and 
gave off a smell like incense. </P>
<P> &quot;We will have some capital hunting, you and I,&quot; said the general. 
&quot;I shall be most glad to have your society.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;But what game&#8212;&quot; began Rainsford. </P>
<P> &quot;I'll tell you,&quot; said the general. &quot;You will be amused, I know. I 
think I may say, in all modesty, that I have done a rare thing. I have 
invented a new sensation. May I pour you another glass of port?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Thank you, general.&quot; </P>
<P> The general filled both glasses, and said, &quot;God makes some men 
poets. Some He makes kings, some beggars. Me He made a hunter. My hand 
was made for the trigger, my father said. He was a very rich man with a 
quarter of a million acres in the Crimea, and he was an ardent 
sportsman. When I was only five years old he gave me a little gun, 
specially made in Moscow for me, to shoot sparrows with. When I shot 
some of his prize turkeys with it, he did not punish me; he 
complimented me on my marksmanship. I killed my first bear in the 
Caucasus when I was ten. My whole life has been one prolonged hunt. I 
went into the army&#8212;it was expected of noblemen's sons&#8212;and for a 
time commanded a division of Cossack cavalry, but my real interest was 
always the hunt. I have hunted every kind of game in every land. It 
would be impossible for me to tell you how many animals I have killed.&quot; </P>
<P> The general puffed at his cigarette. </P>
<P> &quot;After the debacle in Russia I left the country, for it was 
imprudent for an officer of the Czar to stay there. Many noble Russians 
lost everything. I, luckily, had invested heavily in American 
securities, so I shall never have to open a tea-room in Monte Carlo or 
drive a taxi in Paris. Naturally, I continued to hunt&#8212;grizzliest in 
your Rockies, crocodiles in the Ganges, rhinoceroses in East Africa. It 
was in Africa that the Cape buffalo hit me and laid me up for six 
months. As soon as I recovered I started for the Amazon to hunt 
jaguars, for I had heard they were unusually cunning. They weren't.&quot; 
The Cossack sighed. &quot;They were no match at all for a hunter with his 
wits about him, and a high-powered rifle. I was bitterly disappointed. </P>
<P> I was lying in my tent with a splitting headache one night when a 
terrible thought pushed its way into my mind. Hunting was beginning to 
bore me! And hunting, remember, had been my life. I have heard that in 
America businessmen often go to pieces when they give up the business 
that has been their life.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Yes, that's so,&quot; said Rainsford. </P>
<P> The general smiled. &quot;I had no wish to go to pieces,&quot; he said. &quot;I 
must do something. Now, mine is an analytical mind, Mr. Rainsford. 
Doubtless that is why I enjoy the problems of the chase.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;No doubt, General Zaroff.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;So,&quot; continued the general, &quot;I asked myself why the hunt no longer 
fascinated me. You are much younger than I am, Mr. Rainsford, and have 
not hunted as much, but you perhaps can guess the answer.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;What was it?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Simply this: hunting had ceased to be what you call `a sporting 
proposition.' It had become too easy. I always got my quarry. Always. 
There is no greater bore than perfection.&quot; </P>
<P> The general lit a fresh cigarette. </P>
<P> &quot;No animal had a chance with me any more. That is no boast; it is a 
mathematical certainty. The animal had nothing but his legs and his 
instinct. Instinct is no match for reason. When I thought of this it 
was a tragic moment for me, I can tell you.&quot; </P>
<P> Rainsford leaned across the table, absorbed in what his host was 
saying. </P>
<P> &quot;It came to me as an inspiration what I must do,&quot; the general went 
on. </P>
<P> &quot;And that was?&quot; </P>
<P> The general smiled the quiet smile of one who has faced an obstacle 
and surmounted it with success. &quot;I had to invent a new animal to hunt,&quot; 
he said. </P>
<P> &quot;A new animal? You're joking.&quot; &quot;Not at all,&quot; said the general. &quot;I 
never joke about hunting. I needed a new animal. I found one. So I 
bought this island built this house, and here I do my hunting. The 
island is perfect for my purposes&#8212;there are jungles with a maze of 
traits in them, hills, swamps&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;But the animal, General Zaroff?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Oh,&quot; said the general, &quot;it supplies me with the most exciting 
hunting in the world. No other hunting compares with it for an instant. 
Every day I hunt, and I never grow bored now, for I have a quarry with 
which I can match my wits.&quot; </P>
<P> Rainsford's bewilderment showed in his face. </P>
<P> &quot;I wanted the ideal animal to hunt,&quot; explained the general. &quot;So I 
said, `What are the attributes of an ideal quarry?' And the answer was, 
of course, `It must have courage, cunning, and, above all, it must be 
able to reason.&quot;' &quot;But no animal can reason,&quot; objected Rainsford. </P>
<P> &quot;My dear fellow,&quot; said the general, &quot;there is one that can.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;But you can't mean&#8212;&quot; gasped Rainsford. </P>
<P> &quot;And why not?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;I can't believe you are serious, General Zaroff. This is a grisly 
joke.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Why should I not be serious? I am speaking of hunting.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Hunting? Great Guns, General Zaroff, what you speak of is murder.&quot; </P>
<P> The general laughed with entire good nature. He regarded Rainsford 
quizzically. &quot;I refuse to believe that so modern and civilised a young 
man as you seem to be harbours romantic ideas about the value of human 
life. Surely your experiences in the war&#8212;&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Did not make me condone cold-blooded murder,&quot; finished Rainsford 
stiffly. </P>
<P> Laughter shook the general. &quot;How extraordinarily droll you are!&quot; he 
said. &quot;One does not expect nowadays to find a young man of the educated 
class, even in America, with such a naive, and, if I may say so, 
mid-Victorian point of view. It's like finding a snuffbox in a 
limousine. Ah, well, doubtless you had Puritan ancestors. So many 
Americans appear to have had. I'll wager you'll forget your notions 
when you go hunting with me. You've a genuine new thrill in store for 
you, Mr. Rainsford.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Thank you, I'm a hunter, not a murderer.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Dear me,&quot; said the general, quite unruffled, &quot;again that 
unpleasant word. But I think I can show you that your scruples are 
quite ill founded.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Yes?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Life is for the strong, to be lived by the strong, and, if needs 
be, taken by the strong. </P>
<P> The weak of the world were put here to give the strong pleasure. I 
am strong. Why should I not use my gift? If I wish to hunt, why should 
I not? I hunt the scum of the earth: sailors from tramp ships&#8212;
lassars, blacks, Chinese, whites, mongrels&#8212;a thoroughbred horse or 
hound is worth more than a score of them.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;But they are men,&quot; said Rainsford hotly. </P>
<P> &quot;Precisely,&quot; said the general. &quot;That is why I use them. It gives me 
pleasure. They can reason, after a fashion. So they are dangerous.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;But where do you get them?&quot; </P>
<P> The general's left eyelid fluttered down in a wink. &quot;This island is 
called Ship Trap,&quot; he answered. &quot;Sometimes an angry god of the high 
seas sends them to me. Sometimes, when Providence is not so kind, I 
help Providence a bit. Come to the window with me.&quot; </P>
<P> Rainsford went to the window and looked out toward the sea. </P>
<P> &quot;Watch! Out there!&quot; exclaimed the general, pointing into the night. 
Rainsford's eyes saw only blackness, and then, as the general pressed a 
button, far out to sea Rainsford saw the flash of lights. </P>
<P> The general chuckled. &quot;They indicate a channel,&quot; he said, &quot;where 
there's none; giant rocks with razor edges crouch like a sea monster 
with wide-open jaws. They can crush a ship as easily as I crush this 
nut.&quot; He dropped a walnut on the hardwood floor and brought his heel 
grinding down on it. &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; he said, casually, as if in answer to a 
question, &quot;I have electricity. We try to be civilised here.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;Civilised? And you shoot down men?&quot; </P>
<P> A trace of anger was in the general's black eyes, but it was there 
for but a second; and he said, in his most pleasant manner, &quot;Dear me, 
what a righteous young man you are! I assure you I do not do the thing 
you suggest. That would be barbarous. I treat these visitors with every 
consideration. They get plenty of good food and exercise. They get into 
splendid physical condition. You shall see for yourself tomorrow.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;What do you mean?&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;We'll visit my training school,&quot; smiled the general. &quot;It's in the 
cellar. I have about a dozen pupils down there now. They're from the 
Spanish bark San Lucar that had the bad luck to go on the rocks out 
there. A very inferior lot, I regret to say. Poor specimens and more 
accustomed to the deck than to the jungle.&quot; He raised his hand, and 
Ivan, who served as waiter, brought thick Turkish coffee. Rainsford, 
with an effort, held his tongue in check. </P>
<P> &quot;It's a game, you see,&quot; pursued the general blandly. &quot;I suggest to 
one of them that we go hunting. I give him a supply of food and an 
excellent hunting knife. I give him three hours' sta
